It is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group the unlabeled datasets into a cluster
Hierarchical clustering algorithms falls into following two categories.

1.Agglomerative hierarchical Clustering
2.Divisive hierarchical Clustering

In Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
-Each data point is treated as a single cluster 
-then successively merged or,  agglomerated (bottom-up approach) the pairs of clusters. 
The hierarchy of the clusters is represented as a dendrogram or tree structure.

While in Divisive hierarchical clustering, All the data points are treated as one big cluster 
and then we keep dividing (Top-down approach) the clusters into various small clusters.
