The battery drain is more when on 120 hz but still I get 5 hours screen on time which is good. Also the processor is pretty good for everything considering the price. The only things missing are 1. Amoled panel but 120hz can compensate for it.2. Good night vision optimization3. Better macro camera, it should have been of 5 MP atleast to get good shots.READ MORE&quot;</td>

And trust me it&#39;s been almost 16-17 hrs , I am using thiss and there is no kind of battery drain. The one thing that I want to suggest that do not it&#39;s software.. Let it be the same as it came out of the box because maybe the software is the reason for battery drain. I recommend do not upgrade the software if u want best battery life.

This phone is for mild gaming only, say 2-3 hours per day. The battery charges fast with 30watts, but that&#39;s a convenience thing.The cameras are the best, pricing is on point.

The thing that most catches your eye is the display, really vibrant and almost comparable to oled at this price point. 120hz doesn&#39;t make much of a difference apart from games and system interface.
