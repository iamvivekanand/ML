    "A Chatbot is an AI application that mimics human conversations. It is widely used by companies to solve the most common problems they receive from customers daily. For example, if you want to know the CRN of your bank account, a chatbot will assist you by asking for your bank details, then it will give you your CRN. But if you want to know something that is not that common, like asking how you can turn your account into a joint account, chances are the authorized employee will assist you."
