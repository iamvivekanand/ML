knn is a supervised ML algorithm, Can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
knn assumes the similarity between the New Data and Stored Data
it puts the new data into the category that is most similar to the available categories

In this notebook I have used built in iris dataset for making a classification model using KNN algorithm.
